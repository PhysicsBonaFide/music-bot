# music-bot
Discord music bot using discord.py

This bot is not meant to compete with existing bots like Pancake, it is being developed for fun, and about learning the discord.py[voice] API.

You are allowed to use this bot in your own private Discord servers, but I ask that if you find ways to improve it to please let me know, so I can add in those changes.

I do not claim all the code as original, parts of it I learned from various YouTube tutorials, so feel free to use this code to make your own bot!

Current goal(s) for this bot:
    (1) Add queue system
    (2) Find more goals...
